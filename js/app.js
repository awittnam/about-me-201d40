//Question Six

//As a developer, I want to add a sixth question to my guessing game that takes numeric input by prompting a user to guess a number (for instance, "What is my favorite number?" or "How many Pok√©mon did I catch this week?"), and indicates to the user whether the guess is "too high" or "too low", and gives the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer, so that my fancy programming skills are showcased.

var favNum = 3 //set mu favorite number for them to guess

for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
  var guessNum = Number(prompt('What is my favorite number?')); //converts the guessed num into a number
  console.log(guessNum); //console.log the number guessed

  if (guessNum === favNum) { //if guess is equal to my
  //tell them they are correct
    alert('Great job, you got it!');
    break;
  } else if (guessNum > favNum) {
    alert('That guess was too high.');
  } else if (guessNum < favNum) {
    alert('That guess is too low.');
  }
  if (i === 3) {
    alert('To many attempts.  My number ' + favNum + '.');
  }
